After lining up with the runway, stop the aircraft by applying `BREAK`. Monitor ECAM while push the throttle until 50% N1. After stablizing at 50% N1, push the throttle to TOGA position.
When rolling, apply force on the yoke to keep the head down until 100kt. When above 100kt, smoothly neutralize the yoke. At 160kt, gently pull the yoke to rotate in a rate of 3°/sec until pitch reaches 15°.
