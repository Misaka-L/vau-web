# Startup and Taxiing
::: danger
**For VAU320neo Use Only**
:::
## Getting Seated
![Seat](/v320neo/guide/enter-seat.webp)

Sit to the left when entering.
::: tip
Only the player on the left seat has control for now. Other seats are passenger seats only.
:::
## Startup
![VAU320neo Cockpit](/v320neo/guide/cockpit.webp)
After seated, check that there is no person or unexpected objects on the ground. Then select `Canopy` to close the cabin door (That is `Z` in desktop mode). Select `AUTO START` in order to start the engines (That is `F4` in desktop mode).
::: warning
Do not start the engine without clearing people or unexpected objects on the ground. Although it won't cause any injury directly, it will cause damages to the engine and mess up with the apron. You will likely be beaten by angry people on the ground and thus causing indirect injuries.

![ECAM when startup](/v320neo/guide/ecam-starting-engine.webp)

Monitor ECAM when startup (The screen in red frame in the screenshot). After `AVAIL` is shown on both engine indicators, the startup procedure completes.

## After Startup
![ECAM with configuration 1+F](/v320neo/guide/ecam-after-started-flaps.webp)

After startup, select `Flaps` (That is `F` in desktop mode) to set flaps and slats to `1+F1`. Check that ECAM shows configuration set to `1+F`. Then, select `LANDING LIGHT` (That is `F5` in desktop mode) to turn on the Landing Lights.
::: warning
In real operations, your are not supposed to turn on Landing Lights other than takeoff, landing, entering and exiting the runway. The reason why we turn on Landing Lights here is because VAU320neo has no Taxi Light settings.
:::
## Taxi
Since we are parking at TWY `J1`, we'll need to taxi via `J1, T2, A, A1` to RWY 10L, according to the airport chart of ZVAU.

::: tip
After you apply a little bit throttle to start moving the aircraft, you can then keep the throttle at idle. This is because the engines of VAU320neo provides enough thrust power for taxiing even in idle thrust.
